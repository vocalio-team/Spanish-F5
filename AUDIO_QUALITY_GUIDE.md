# Audio Quality Analysis Guide

## Overview

The Audio Quality Analyzer helps you assess reference audio quality before using it for TTS. Poor quality reference audio leads to poor TTS output, so it's important to use high-quality recordings.

## Quick Start

### Check a Single File

```bash
python examples/check_audio_quality.py path/to/audio.wav
```

### Check All Files in a Directory

```bash
python examples/check_audio_quality.py --check-dir path/to/audio/folder/
```

### Python API

```python
from f5_tts.audio import analyze_audio_quality, print_quality_report

# Analyze audio file
metrics = analyze_audio_quality("reference.wav")

# Print formatted report
print_quality_report(metrics)

# Check programmatically
if metrics.quality_level.value in ['excellent', 'good']:
    print("Audio quality is acceptable")
else:
    print(f"Issues: {', '.join(metrics.issues)}")
    print(f"Recommendations: {', '.join(metrics.recommendations)}")
```

## Quality Metrics Explained

### Overall Score (0-100)

- **90-100 (Excellent)**: Professional quality, ideal for TTS
- **70-89 (Good)**: Very acceptable, minor issues at most
- **50-69 (Fair)**: Usable but may have noticeable artifacts
- **30-49 (Poor)**: Significant issues, output quality will suffer
- **0-29 (Unacceptable)**: Not suitable for TTS, re-record recommended

### Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)

Measures how loud the speech is compared to background noise.

- **35+ dB**: Excellent - studio quality
- **25-35 dB**: Good - clean recording
- **15-25 dB**: Fair - noticeable background noise
- **10-15 dB**: Poor - significant noise
- **< 10 dB**: Unacceptable - very noisy

**Common Issues:**
- Background noise (fans, traffic, hum)
- Room reverberation
- Electronic noise

**Solutions:**
- Record in a quiet environment
- Use acoustic treatment (foam, blankets)
- Use noise reduction software
- Record closer to microphone

### Clipping Rate

Percentage of audio samples that are clipped (distorted).

- **< 0.1%**: Excellent - no perceptible clipping
- **0.1-1%**: Fair - minor clipping
- **1-5%**: Poor - noticeable distortion
- **> 5%**: Unacceptable - severe distortion

**Common Causes:**
- Recording level too high
- Microphone overload
- Compression artifacts

**Solutions:**
- Reduce input gain
- Move further from microphone
- Use a limiter/compressor
- Check for peaks and reduce them

### Silence Ratio

Percentage of the audio that is silence.

- **< 30%**: Excellent - efficient recording
- **30-50%**: Fair - some silence
- **50-70%**: Poor - too much silence
- **> 70%**: Unacceptable - mostly empty

**Common Causes:**
- Long pauses before/after speech
- Recording started too early/late
- Very slow speech with long pauses

**Solutions:**
- Trim silence from beginning/end
- Use voice activity detection (VAD)
- Re-record with better timing

### Dynamic Range

Difference between loudest and quietest parts (in dB).

- **40+ dB**: Excellent - natural, expressive
- **30-40 dB**: Good - some variation
- **20-30 dB**: Fair - somewhat flat
- **15-20 dB**: Poor - very compressed
- **< 15 dB**: Unacceptable - no dynamics

**Common Causes:**
- Over-compression
- Aggressive limiting
- Recording level too low
- Poor microphone technique

**Solutions:**
- Reduce compression/limiting
- Increase recording level
- Use better microphone technique
- Avoid automatic gain control (AGC)

### Spectral Flatness

Measure of how "noisy" vs "tonal" the audio is. Speech should be more tonal (low flatness).

- **< 0.1**: Excellent - clear harmonic structure
- **0.1-0.3**: Good - typical speech
- **0.3-0.5**: Fair - less clear
- **> 0.5**: Poor - may not be speech

**Common Causes:**
- Excessive noise
- Poor recording quality
- Wrong file (music, silence, etc.)
- Heavily processed audio

**Solutions:**
- Ensure file contains clear speech
- Reduce background noise
- Use better recording equipment

## Integration with TTS Workflow

### Pre-inference Check

```python
from f5_tts.api import F5TTS
from f5_tts.audio import analyze_audio_quality, QualityLevel

# Check reference audio quality
metrics = analyze_audio_quality("reference.wav")

if metrics.quality_level in [QualityLevel.POOR, QualityLevel.UNACCEPTABLE]:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Reference audio quality is poor")
    print(f"Issues: {', '.join(metrics.issues)}")
    print("TTS output may be degraded. Consider using better quality reference audio.")

    # Optionally abort
    # raise ValueError("Reference audio quality too low")

# Proceed with TTS
tts = F5TTS()
wav, sr, _ = tts.infer(
    ref_file="reference.wav",
    ref_text="",
    gen_text="Hello world",
)
```

### Batch Processing

```python
from pathlib import Path
from f5_tts.audio import analyze_audio_quality, QualityLevel

def filter_quality_audio(audio_dir, min_score=70):
    """Filter audio files by quality score."""
    good_files = []
    poor_files = []

    for audio_file in Path(audio_dir).glob("*.wav"):
        metrics = analyze_audio_quality(str(audio_file))

        if metrics.overall_score >= min_score:
            good_files.append(str(audio_file))
        else:
            poor_files.append((str(audio_file), metrics.overall_score))

    return good_files, poor_files

# Usage
good, poor = filter_quality_audio("reference_audio/", min_score=70)

print(f"‚úÖ {len(good)} files passed quality check")
print(f"‚ùå {len(poor)} files failed quality check")

if poor:
    print("\nFiles needing attention:")
    for file, score in poor:
        print(f"  ‚Ä¢ {Path(file).name}: {score:.1f}/100")
```
